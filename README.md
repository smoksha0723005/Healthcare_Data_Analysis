# Project Documentation for Patient Waitlist Analysis Dashboard
## 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze patient waitlist trends across different case types, specialties, and age profiles to improve hospital resource planning, reduce waiting times, and enhance patient experience. The dashboard provides actionable insights into monthly trends, waitlist bifurcation, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for better decision-making.

## 2. Key Questions & KPIs
How has the patient waitlist changed over time? (Total Waitlist Comparison, Monthly Trend Analysis)
Which case types (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient) have the highest wait times? (Waitlist Bifurcation by Case Type)
Which specialties contribute the most to patient waitlists? (Top 5 Specialties by Waitlist)
What is the median wait time across different time bands and age groups? (Waitlist Analysis - Time Band vs Age Profile)

## 3. Process
Data Collection & Preparation: Extracted patient waitlist data from hospital records, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed missing values, standardized date formats, and categorized patient groups by age, case type, and specialty.
Data Analysis & Visualization: Used Power BI to create interactive charts, KPIs, and filters, enabling easy data exploration.
Dashboard Development: Designed summary and detailed views, integrating filtering options for granular analysis.

## 5. Project Insights
The latest patient waitlist shows an increase to 709K compared to 640K in the previous period, indicating a rise in demand for healthcare services.
Outpatient cases account for the majority of the waitlist, with significant growth observed in recent years.
The 18+ months wait time category has the highest volume of patients, showing inefficiencies in service delivery for long-term waiting cases.
Anaesthetics and Cardiology have the highest patient backlog, requiring priority attention in hospital resource planning.
Day Case and Inpatient trends have remained stable, while outpatient cases have seen a steady rise, demanding better scheduling strategies.

## 6. Final Conclusion
The analysis highlights a rising patient waitlist trend, with outpatient services contributing the most to the backlog. Hospitals should focus on reducing wait times for long-term cases, optimizing specialty-wise resource allocation, and improving patient flow management. The interactive dashboard enables data-driven decision-making, allowing stakeholders to monitor trends, adjust resources, and enhance hospital efficiency.
